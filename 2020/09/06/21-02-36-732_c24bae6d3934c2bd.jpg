Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The putative confession (PC) instructions (“[suspect] told me everything that happened and wants you to tell the truth”) increases children’s honesty. However, research has shown that children who maintain secrecy despite the PC are more convincing. We examined whether (a) the PC undermines adults’ deception detection abilities or (b) children who conceal despite the PC are better deceivers. Adults evaluated truthful and deceptive children interviewed with the PC where the PC portion of the interview was either present or absent. Adults’ deception detection was no worse when the PC was present; in fact, it was slightly better. Rather than negatively affecting adults’ ability to detect deception, the PC selects an unusually convincing group of concealers.</p>

				<p>Samuel Norris (University of Chicago), Matthew Pecenco (University of California, Berkeley - University of California, Berkeley) and Jeffrey Weaver (University of Southern California) have published <a href="https://privhq.ssrn.com/Journals/RedirectClick.cfm?url=https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3644719::dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_corrections:sentencing:law:policy:ejournal_abstractlink&amp;partid=95874&amp;did=494443&amp;eid=228765"><strong>&quot;The Effect of Incarceration on Mortality&quot;</strong></a> on SSRN. Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This paper analyzes the effect of incarceration on mortality using administrative data from Ohio between 1992 and 2017. Using event study and difference-in-differences approaches, we compare mortality risk across incarcerated and non-incarcerated individuals before and after pre-scheduled releases from prison. Mortality risk halves during the period of incarceration, with large declines in murders, overdoses, and medical causes of death. However, there is no detectable effect on post-release mortality risk, meaning that incarceration increases overall longevity. We estimate that incarceration averts nearly two thousand deaths annually in the US, comparable to the 2014 Medicaid expansion.</p>

				<p>Cherie Metcalf (Queen&#39;s University - Faculty of Law), Emily Satterthwaite (University of Toronto Faculty of Law), Shahar Dillbary (University of Alabama School of Law), and Brock Stoddard (Appalachian State University - Department of Economics) have published <a href="https://privhq.ssrn.com/Journals/RedirectClick.cfm?url=https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3659604::dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_law,:cognition,:decisionmaking:ejournal_abstractlink&amp;partid=95874&amp;did=494480&amp;eid=209270"><strong>&quot;Is a Fine Still a Price? Replication as Robustness in Empirical Legal Studies&quot;</strong></a>&#0160; on SSRN. Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Can fines lead to more of an undesirable behavior, rather than deterring it? This was the surprising finding in Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini, “A Fine is a Price” published in the Journal of Legal Studies in 2000. In this field experiment at Israeli daycares, the introduction of fines caused an increase in late pick-ups by parents. The study has been frequently cited, especially for its suggestion that a fine can act as a price for non-compliance that “crowds-out” social norms and motivations for individuals.<br /><br />In this article, we conduct two related studies to explore the robustness of Gneezy &amp; Rustichini’s findings and the relevance of their suggested explanations. We seek to replicate their results using experimental surveys administered on MTurk, an increasingly common methodology in empirical legal studies, psychology and economics. While not an exact replication, it allows us to control aspects of the experimental design that are difficult to replicate in the field. We are also able to directly investigate whether fines persistently change the way respondents perceive the consequences (signaling, completing the contract) or relevant social motivations (crowding-out), as suggested by Gneezy &amp; Rustichini. In the first study we translate the original daycare field setting into a vignette-based experimental survey. Our second study similarly investigates the effect of introducing a fine on income tax reporting compliance – an example suggested in the original study. In both studies, respondents are randomized into experimental conditions exposing them to one of two alternate fines or a social norm-based measure. We solicit multiple compliance measures for respondents along with measures of the importance of the alternate explanations to their decisions.<br /><br />Our survey results do not replicate the original findings. In both our daycare and tax studies, the introduction of fines causes respondents to reduce non-compliant behaviour. Respondents expect others to behave similarly. Fines do not cause respondents to adjust their concerns about an incomplete contract consistently with Gneezy &amp; Rustichini’s theory. They also show very little evidence of fines crowding out social motivations, despite being responsive to our social treatments. The effects of fines on outcome behaviours and respondents’ reasons are transitory. Once the fines are removed, our respondents return to their baseline behaviours. The survey results are consistent with intuitive judgments (and standard rational-choice theory) that fines deter. A survey is not a field experiment; however, our results suggest that more research is required to understand when and how any “fine is a price” effect may arise.</p>

Here is the abstract:&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Memory issues are well-known in legal trials that involve the reliability of eyewitnesses in criminal cases. However, the relevance of memory to law extends far beyond that context. We describe the importance of, and concerns with, different facets of memory in a range of legal doctrine and processes. For example, in product liability cases, witness memory provides key evidence, but such civil cases differ in both the content of the memories and the procedures used to elicit them. In intellectual property cases, memory for trademarks and potential cryptomnesia (unconscious plagiarism) may be used in assessing liability. In contracts and negotiations, parties’ memory may be useful, or not, when trying to make sense of the content of an agreement. Prospective memory, that is, remembering to do tasks in the future, is relevant to liability for actions as diverse as injury resulting from not following product warnings to forgetting a child in the backseat of a car. And neurologically impaired memory has consequences for attributions of blame and guilt. We end by providing brief reviews of some recent research on memory’s involvement in investigations and in courtrooms (particularly in the U.S.) including: eyewitness testimony, confessions, consequences of pretrial publicity and expert testimony, and the effectiveness of jury instructions for both disregarding evidence and improving juror decision making. Throughout we try to illustrate relationships between the law and different facets of memory described in this Handbook.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In Atkins v. Virginia, the Supreme Court held that executing individuals with intellectual disability violates the Constitution. Due to this categorical exemption, the accuracy and reliability of an intellectual disability determination is literally a matter of life or death. We tested the influence of context on mild intellectual disability diagnosis in a sample of 179 people with intellectual disability expertise. We found that experts diagnosed intellectual disability at nearly identical rates in death penalty and disability benefits cases. Men, Republicans, and people who believed intellectual disability is not an excuse for a crime were significantly less likely to diagnose intellectual disability in both types of cases. These findings suggest that in this sample, the facts of the crime did not cause the experts to refrain from diagnosing intellectual disability.</p>

Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Article examines the public health response to COVID-19 within federal and state prisons and local jails. Prisons and jails are often a hotbed of airborne infections like COVID-19 as a result of chronic overcrowding, unavoidably close living quarters, and incarcerated people’s underlying health risk factors. Proposals for handling coronavirus vary but tend to include the incorporation of prevention measures within congregate settings as well as the return of individuals to their local communities in order to facilitate physical distancing. This Article identifies ethical tradeoffs and sets priorities for incarcerated people’s return to communities. In Parts I and II, we provide background on why the COVID-19 pandemic is especially dangerous within correctional facilities and lay out the various enacted and proposed public health responses. In Part III, we provide moral, practical, and legal arguments for supporting the early release of incarcerated individuals that stand independently of specific views about criminal detention and theories of legal punishment. In the last part, we set priorities for which individuals to release first. These are individuals who (1) have low risk of recidivism for a violent offense, (2) are being held pretrial, (3) have high risk of mortality from COVID-19, (4) are nearing the end of their sentences, and (5) have custodial responsibilities to third parties.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The promise (or threat) of so-called Robot Judges has captured the attention of popular media and legal scholarship. But little has been said about the details. How would automated judging actually work? Specifically, how does one translate big data and probabilistic predictions into judgments? Exploring the effect of using litigation assessment algorithms in judicial decision making, this article models one form of automated judging. We show that the use of algorithms to assist or automate judicial decision making can distort litigation and settlement outcomes. The particulars of distortion depend on the methods that judges use to translate predictions into judgments. Each method available is accompanied by different costs and different trade offs.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Vera Bergelson (Rutgers Law School - Newark) has published <a href="https://privhq.ssrn.com/Journals/RedirectClick.cfm?url=https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3631204::dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_criminal:law:ejournal_abstractlink&amp;partid=95874&amp;did=491142&amp;eid=507021"><strong>&quot;Sex and Sensibility: The Meaning of Sexual Consent&quot;</strong></a>&#0160;on SSRN. Here is the abstract:&#0160;<br /><a href="mailto:vera_bergelson@yahoo.com"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In this paper, I argue against the dominant academic view that consent in sexual crimes should be understood and defined as performative. Instead, I advocate the attitudinal model of consent which focuses on the internal feelings of the parties rather than their external expression. My criticisms of the performative model of consent can be briefly summarized as follows.<br /><br />A rape statute based on the performative model is over-inclusive and unjust. Consider two sexual partners, Adam and Eve. Under the law based on the performative model, Adam would be guilty of rape in any circumstances when Eve wholeheartedly welcomed intimacy with Adam but, for any reason, failed to express her feelings. Adam would be guilty of rape even if he honestly believed that Eve welcomed their intimacy and, in fact, was correct in that belief. The performative model thus would authorize criminal punishment in the absence of either wrongful harm or culpability.<br /><br />By disregarding Eve’s choice to have sex on her terms (without outwardly expressing consent), the law disregards Eve’s autonomy and treats her as a legally incompetent individual, incapable of independent decisions and requiring special protection.<br /><br />Denying normative force to Eve’s attitudinal consent imposes on Eve an affirmative duty, on the pain of her partner’s criminal conviction, to behave, in the most intimate situations, not how she prefers but how the state tells her to behave. Under the performative standard, Eve may not have sex unless she explicitly sexually encourages her partner. The rape laws based on the performative standard would undercut decades of legal battles fought in the name of privacy, autonomy, and respect for sexual liberty.<br /><br />Such laws are offensively paternalistic in that they categorically invalidate Eve’s consent unless she satisfies the absolutist, good-for-all, statutory requirement (explicit encouragement of her partner). Moreover, such laws are implicitly sexist and strongly smack of the infamous requirement of “corroboration” motivated by distrust to women in anything related to sex.<br /><br />The performative model is not suited better than attitudinal to target sexual misconduct. The paper reviews legal outcomes in a number of scenarios presenting different interplays of wrongdoing and culpability from the attitudinal and performative perspectives. The comparison of the two models demonstrates the advantages of the attitudinal model over performative in producing a just and proportionate punishment.<br /><br />The paper concludes that attitudinal model of consent in sexual crimes has both doctrinal and practical advantages over the performative. The paper also considers college disciplinary rules regulating students’ sexual conduct and concludes that a model of “contextual consent” may be more appropriate for such rules.</p>

The Court justified reversing the burden of proof by appealing to the impossibility of requiring the Crown to disprove automatism claims and the need to ensure accused persons do not feign a defence. In so doing, however, the Court failed to consider the economic impact of its decision. As pleading automatism requires calling an expert witness, it is likely that many impecunious accused are unable to call required testimony strictly based on their financial status. In other instances, the cost of conviction and punishment might be less than hiring an expert and thus deter an accused from pleading automatism. To address these problems, I develop an alternative approach for proving automatism that requires both Crown and defence share the burden of proof. Adopting this approach is necessary, I maintain, to justify the infringement of the presumption of innocence inherent in requiring accused persons to prove an automatism defence.</p>

				<p>Alex Raskolnikov (Columbia University - Law School) has published <a href="https://privhq.ssrn.com/Journals/RedirectClick.cfm?url=https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3617357::dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_criminology:ejournal_abstractlink&amp;partid=95874&amp;did=489681&amp;eid=885791"><strong>&quot;Criminal Deterrence: A Review of the Missing Literature&quot;</strong></a>&#0160;on SSRN. Here is the abstract:<br /><a href="mailto:arasko@law.columbia.edu"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This review of the criminal deterrence literature focuses on the questions that are largely missing from many recent, excellent, comprehensive reviews of that literature, and from the literature itself. By “missing” I mean, first, questions that criminal deterrence scholars have ignored either completely or to a large extent. These questions range from fundamental (the distributional analysis of the criminal justice system), to those hidden in plain sight (economic analysis of misdemeanors), to those that are well-know yet mostly overlooked (the role of positive incentives, offender’s mental state, and celerity of punishment). I also use “missing” to refer to the areas where substantial relevant knowledge exists but is largely disregarded within the criminal deterrence research program. The empirical analysis of environmental and tax compliance are two stark examples. Finally, I stretch “missing” to describe topics that have been both studied and reviewed, but where substantial challenges remain. These include the theoretical explanation for the role of offense history, the proper accounting for the offender’s gains, the estimation of the costs of various crimes, and the cost-benefit analysis of crime-reduction policies.<br /><br />Among the literature’s missing pieces, several stand out both on their own and because they combine to produce a highly unfortunate result. First, the literature makes only a minor effort to estimate the cost of crime, and essentially no effort to estimate the cost of white-collar offenses. Combined with no centralized reporting of white-collar crimes and, therefore, no empirical analysis of them, the literature adds to the impression — not supported by the available evidence — that street crime is a great social problem while white-collar crime is a minor one. Second, the literature fails to treat misdemeanors (and misdemeanor enforcement) as an independent subject of study. This creates an impression — also unjustified — that thirteen million or so misdemeanor charges a year — and countless millions of stops, frisks, and interrogations that lead to no charges—all heavily skewed by race and class — are not a major social problem either. Third, the literature is only starting to develop a benefit-cost analysis of various crime-reducing strategies. This analysis almost exclusively considers measures reflected in the optimal deterrence model and, therefore, internal to the criminal justice system. This creates an impression — almost surely false — that deterrence is the only means of reducing future crime. Finally, the literature ignores distributional analysis altogether, even though the burdens of crime and the criminal justice system vary dramatically, predictably, and disturbingly by race and income. By disregarding this variation, the literature may be reinforcing it. For all these reasons, the criminal deterrence literature may well be contributing to the overwhelming, singular focus of American society and law enforcement on the forceful deterrence of street crime. Addressing the missing pieces would enrich the literature, expand its appeal and policy-relevance, and enable academics to contribute to the effort of setting the US criminal justice system on the path of long-overdue structural reforms.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Laws against wrongdoing may originate in justice intuitions that are part of universal human nature, according to the adaptationist theory of the origins of criminal law. This theory proposes that laws can be traced to neuro-cognitive mechanisms and ancestral selection pressures. According to this theory, laypeople can intuitively recreate the laws of familiar and unfamiliar cultures, even when they lack the relevant explicit knowledge. Here, to evaluate this prediction, we conduct experiments with Chinese and Sumerian laws that are millennia old; stimuli that preserve in fossil-like form the legal thinking of ancient lawmakers. We show that laypeople’s justice intuitions closely match the logic and content of those archaic laws. We also show co-variation across different types of justice intuitions: interpersonal devaluation of offenders, judgments of moral wrongness, mock-legislated punishments and perpetrator shame — suggesting that multiple justice intuitions may be regulated by a common social-evaluative psychology. Although alternative explanations of these findings are possible, we argue that they are consistent with the assumption that the origin of criminal law is a cognitively sophisticated human nature.</p>

				<p>Emily R. Murphy (University of California Hastings College of the Law) and Jesse Rissman (University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)) have published <a href="https://privhq.ssrn.com/Journals/RedirectClick.cfm?url=https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3601016::dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_law:neuroscience:ejournal_abstractlink&amp;partid=95874&amp;did=488254&amp;eid=140067"><strong>&quot;Evidence of Memory from Brain Data&quot;</strong></a> on SSRN. Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Much courtroom evidence relies on assessing witness memory. Recent advances in brain imaging analysis techniques offer new information about the nature of autobiographical memory, and introduce the potential for brain-based memory detection. In particular, the use of powerful machine learning algorithms reveals the limits of technological capacities to detect true memories, and contributes to existing psychological understanding that all memory is potentially flawed. This Article first provides the conceptual foundation for brain-based memory detection as evidence. It then comprehensively reviews of the state of the art in brain-based memory detection research before establishing a framework for admissibility of brain-based memory detection evidence in the courtroom and considering whether and how such a use would be consistent with notions of justice. The central question that this interdisciplinary analysis presents is: if the science is sophisticated enough to demonstrate that accurate, veridical memory detection is limited by biological, rather than technological, constraints, what should that understanding mean for broader legal conceptions of how memory is traditionally assessed and relied upon in legal proceedings? Ultimately, we argue that courtroom admissibility is presently a misdirected pursuit, though there is still much to be gained from advancing our understanding of the biology of human memory.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Nulla poena sine lege — no punishment without law — is one of the oldest and most universally accepted principles of English and American law. Today, thousands of American prisoners are placed in long-term solitary confinement despite the fact that such placement is authorized neither by penal statute nor by judicial sentence. Is solitary confinement “punishment without law,” or is it a mere exercise of administrative discretion? <br /><br />In 1890, in a case called In re Medley, the Supreme Court held that solitary confinement is a separate punishment subject to constitutional restraints, but it has ignored this holding in recent decades. Part I of the Essay that follows describes the Supreme Court’s existing case law governing prison officials’ discretion to impose harsher conditions on inmates. Part II analyzes English and American constitutional history relating to the need to limit discretion over punishment, the danger of executive discretion in the infliction of punishment, and the distillation of a standard relevant to determining whether a given government action is a punishment. Finally, Part III checks the accuracy of the Supreme Court’s conclusion in Medley that the harshness of solitary confinement makes it a new punishment by examining historical and modern empirical data relating to the effects of solitary confinement, and concludes that the Medley court was correct.</p>

				<p>Re&#39;em Segev (Hebrew University of Jerusalem – Faculty of Law) has published <a href="https://privhq.ssrn.com/Journals/RedirectClick.cfm?url=https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3591115::dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_criminal:law:ejournal_abstractlink&amp;partid=95874&amp;did=487747&amp;eid=977519"><strong>&quot;Continuity in Morality and Law&quot;</strong></a> on SSRN. Here is the abstract:&#0160;<br /><a href="mailto:reem.segev@mail.huji.ac.il"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">According to the an influential and intuitively appealing argument (the Continuity Argument): (1) morality is usually continuous, namely, a gradual change in one morally significant factor triggers a gradual change in another; (2) the law should usually track morality; (3) therefore, the law should often be continuous. This argument is illustrated by cases such as the following example: since the moral difference between a defensive action that is reasonable and one that is just short of being reasonable is small, the law should not impose a severe punishment when the action is almost reasonable and no punishment at all when action is reasonable (as positive law sometimes does). In this paper, I consider two doubts regarding this argument. First, the premise that morality is continuous in such cases is incompatible with the common view that the moral status of actions is not continuous since there is an important difference between actions that are permissible and actions that are wrong – even if this difference is due to a difference that is very small, such as the one between an action whose consequences are the best and an action whose consequences are just slightly less good. This view extends also to the overall moral status of agents given the common assumption that it depends on the moral status of their actions. This is an important challenge that the Continuity Argument should confront. However, I argue that the best account of morality is more scalar than the common view in these respects. Therefore, I conclude that the first premise of the Continuity Argument is correct in this regard, although it is based on a minority view. The second doubt concerns the scope of the second premise: since there are both reasons in favor and reasons against legal continuity, and the applicability and force of these reasons depend not only on various moral propositions but also on contingent non-moral facts, we lack the evidence to determine the degree to which the law, at a certain place and time, should be continuous and specifically that it should be often continuous.</p>

				<p>Jacob Bronsther (Harvard Law School) has published <a href="https://privhq.ssrn.com/Journals/RedirectClick.cfm?url=https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3595359::dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_criminal:law:ejournal_abstractlink&amp;partid=95874&amp;did=486533&amp;eid=282107"><strong>&quot;The Corrective Justice Theory of Punishment&quot;</strong></a> on SSRN.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The American penal system is racist, degrading, and inefficient. Nonetheless, we cannot give up on punishment entirely, for social peace and cooperation depend on the deterrent threat of the criminal sanction. The question — central to determining the degree to which punishment <em>is</em> justified — is why society’s need for general deterrence is an offender’s problem. Why is it <em>his</em> responsibility to scare off would-be future offenders? His past offense does not magically render him accountable for the actions of total strangers. Existing theories of criminal justice are unable to answer this question.<br /><br />This Article fills the lacuna — justifying state punishment, but, more importantly, establishing its moral limits — with the help of tort law principles. It argues that deterrent punishment can be justified as a means of rectifying an offender’s contribution to “criminality” — not merely the perceived, but the objective threat of crime in society. Criminality chills the exercise of our rights, forces us to take expensive precautions, and exposes us to unreasonable risks of harm. By having increased the level of criminality in the past, an offender owes a duty of repair to society as a whole, a duty of “corrective justice” in the language of tort theorists. He can fulfill this duty by decreasing the threat of crime in the future. In this way, deterrent punishment does not merely sacrifice him to limit the problem of future crime, for which he has no personal responsibility. Rather, it forces him to fulfill his own duty of repair. <br /><br />This novel theory — <em>the corrective justice theory of punishment</em> — entails three sentencing principles. First, punishment must in fact deter crime and must be the most efficient means of doing so. Second, however efficient it may be, punishment must not harm an offender more than is required to repair his criminality contribution. Third, even if it is both efficient and reparative, punishment must not harm an offender to a degree that is entirely out of proportion to the harm prevented by doing so. The Article demonstrates how these three principles, in combination, demand a radical reduction in American sentencing scales. The Article thus concludes that the corrective justice view presents stable moral ground for the decarceral movement in America.</p>
